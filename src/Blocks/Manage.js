              We are digitalizing the value chain of food crops by building
              tools for agro-processors, easing activities like weighing,
              quality control, extension services among others.

              Agro-processors can manage their supply relationships with farmers
              and other suppliers digitally. Suppliers donâ€™t have to wait for
              days to get the payment for supplying an agro-processor, courtesy
              of an entirely digitised process.
